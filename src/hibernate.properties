														# continually, and ignores this parameter. It is included for JDBC3 completeness.

#hibernate.c3p0.test_connection_on_checkout=false		#C3P0 default: false. Don't use it, this feature is very expensive. If set to true, an operation will be performed at every
														# connection checkout to verify that the connection is valid. A better choice is to verify connections periodically using
														# c3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod.

#hibernate.c3p0.auto_commit_on_close=false  			# C3P0 default: false. The JDBC spec is unfortunately silent on what should happen to unresolved, pending transactions
														# on Connection close. C3P0's default policy is to rollback any uncommitted, pending work. (I think this is absolutely,
														# undeniably the right policy, but there is no consensus among JDBC driver vendors.) Setting autoCommitOnClose to true
														# causes uncommitted pending work to be committed, rather than rolled back on Connection close. [Note: Since the spec
														# is absurdly unclear on this question, application authors who wish to avoid bugs and inconsistent behavior should ensure
														# that all transactions are explicitly either committed or rolled-back before close is called.

#hibernate.c3p0.force_ignore_unresolved_transactions=f 	# Strongly disrecommended. Setting this to true may lead to subtle and bizarre bugs.
														# This is a terrible setting, leave it alone unless absolutely necessary. It is here to work around broken databases / JDBC drivers
